        <p class="lead">Shotgun Shock is a fully adjustable air suspension which gives you the option of raising and lowering your bike.

            Adjust rebound AND compression at ANY ride height, with the flip of a switch, on the fly as you ride.
            
            Made in America. Family owned and operated.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>I partnered with the Shotgun Shock team to create a new logo and Shopify store. They are looking to update the look and feel of the brand.</p>

      <!-- Research -->
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="display-4">Research</h1>
        <p class="lead">To start, I took a look at the logos that they used in the past. Their suspension kit is a hit in the latino harley community. I got inspired by the cholo style caligraphy.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>After talking with the team, we settled on two creative directions to explore for the first round of logos. They wanted to see some American Harley logo variations along with some Mexican Gangster Style Harley logos.</p>

         <!-- Problem Statement -->
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="display-4">Problem Statement</h1>
        <p class="lead">The main issue with their previous site was that there weren't up to date product variation and many customers got lost in the checkout process. This led to a huge influx of customer service calls which drove the team crazy.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>By building the new site on Shopify, the fulfillment team will have a much easier time keeping track of orders and sales metrics.</p>

         <!-- Iterations -->
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="display-4">Iterations</h1>
        <p class="lead">Below are some logo iteration examples. This was the first round of revisions. They ended up choosing the first logo. The only change they wanted to make was adding a "railroad" inspired font.</p>

                <p class="lead">Now we have our first prototype. Alot of the design decisions were made to pay homage to their history while welcoming in modern style</p>
